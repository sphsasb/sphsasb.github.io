              Hey, tigers! My name is Samantha L and I'm running to be your next Commissioner General. I'd like to lead the commission next year as I've been class president for the past two years. I've grown a lot within my time in ASB so far and I'd like to take my role a step further and take on this role. During this, I've learned the ropes of being in class office and I have a solid idea of what goes on in a typical commission meeting. To make sure these meetings are as efficient as possible, I will always make sure to have a pre-planned agenda, speak with our advisor beforehand, and have a clear schedule of what is going on. Not only will I be capable of this, but my past two years in ASB will also allow me to help class officers as well. Overall, I believe that I am fit for this role. Remember to vote Lopez 4 General!

            <span>Commissioner of Internal Affairs</span>
            <p>
              Hey SPHS! I‚Äôm Joshua O and I'm running for Commissioner of Internal Affairs (CIA).
Being the current Vice President of Junior Class continued to motivate me to serve in the student leadership role. Serving in our high school ASB for the last three years and in Varsity Tennis has given me the experience necessary to lead, advocate, manage time, and facilitate teamwork. In addition,  for three years I have represented the class of 2023 in the Student Site Council meetings with SPHS staff members, parents, and teachers, so I have this skill set under my belt.

I hope to be elected as your Commissioner of Internal Affairs because I look forward to continuing to represent the student body and act as the student voice at school board meetings and much more. Along with the ASB Junior officers this year, we successfully organized and coordinated events this year.  Here are just to name a few: the HOCO, various class fundraisers, a toy drive for a children's hospital, and the much-anticipated Prom coming in a couple of months.
        
Vote Joshua for Commissioner of Internal Affairs!

            <p>
              Hi everyone! My name is Chloe S and I‚Äôm running to be your next Commissioner of Correspondence. One of the responsibilities of this position consists of taking minutes during meetings. As someone who likes taking notes, I feel that this would be a great opportunity for me to not only be doing something that I enjoy, but at the same time be contributing to our student body as a whole. What makes me unique compared to other candidates is that I have a genuine interest in what goes on at our school, and am eager to be present in any and all meetings or events. Something I often see around campus is a lack of participation in school activities. As Commissioner of Correspondence, I believe that I would have an increased knowledge of these events, and as a result would have the ability to go out and encourage the student body to become more involved.

            <span>Commissioner of Finance</span>
            <p>
              As long as I can remember, I have been in many athletic and leadership teams my whole life, which has shaped me to be a person with accountability, time management skills, and integrity.  In addition, being in ASB as the class Treasurer since my Freshman year, has taught me skills about managing the budget and organization of our class financial account, which includes filling out check requests, bank deposits, and other transactions necessary. I planned and organized many profitable fundraising events for the Class of 2023.  All of these experiences motivate me to run for Commissioner of Finance.

As the current Junior class Treasurer, I helped facilitate and/or coordinate HOCO, holiday toy drive for a children‚Äôs hospital, various fundraisers, and the upcoming prom. As I head towards my last year at SPHS, I hope to be elected as the Commissioner of Finance to continue to ensure and help our school be successful and financially sustainable. 

Vote Matthew for Commissioner of Finance!

            <h4>Charlie B</h4>
            <span>Commissioner of Academics</span>
            <p>
              Hi SPHS. 

My name is Charlie B, and I am running to be your next Commissioner of Academics. As an academically oriented individual, this role appeals to me. Our school is challenging, and I want all students to feel proud of their accomplishments and effort. If I were elected, I would advocate for more TAG days, Tiger articles, and assembly features to recognize academic achievement at all levels. As phenomenal as our after school tutoring resources are, many kids have extracurricular activities immediately after school and need an alternative later in the day via Zoom. 

I feel like SPHS can do a lot more to support seniors as they anticipate life after high school. Many kids might benefit from structured information on trade schools, technical institutes, and other opportunities besides college. But seniors who do apply to college need more support from the administration as they go through the stressful application process. Other schools give seniors days off to work on their applications, and it‚Äôs time for our school to do the same. Finally, in an effort to ensure all of our voices are heard, I‚Äôd institute a suggestion box where students can leave anonymous feedback and ideas suggesting how the administration could support students and improve our campus. Ideally, we‚Äôd also have a process in place for students to evaluate teachers at the end of each semester since they get to evaluate us all the time. 

Signing off, 
Charlie Betts

            <p>
              Hey Tigers! I‚Äôm Audrey X, running to be your future Commissioner of Activities! Why I was motivated to run for this position is because I want to keep increasing school spirit around our campus. As this year‚Äôs Commissioner of Spirit, I‚Äôve already been working towards that goal and as Commissioner of Activities next year, I hope to host more spirit days such as a white lies spirit day, a country vs country club spirit day, a high school stereotype spirit day, and many more! I feel that our student body hasn‚Äôt been included as much in decisions ASB makes around campus. So for the next year, I plan to include the voices and opinions of the student body when deciding on future spirit days and activities. Another responsibility that my position handles is Winter Formal. Since I‚Äôve been on Commission before, I‚Äôve gained the experience of planning huge events such as Color Day or Homecoming! My goal for the upcoming year is to make it the best we‚Äôve ever had and I won‚Äôt be able to do it without your help! I hope you all consider me, Audrey Xie, as your next Commissioner of Activities. Thank you!

            <h4>Alexa M</h4>
            <span>Commissioner of Assemblies</span>
            <p>
              My initial motivation to run was the lack of diversity I saw in our current Assemblies. Often participants chosen to play games in assemblies were friends of ASB members which isn't the issue, the issue is we should have a wider range of students to pick from. So everyone who wants to participate can. I also think assemblies are a sign of comradery at SPHS and they need to be treated with more effort. For example, making fun of freshmen and calling out teachers these small things create a tighter bond for the SPHS student body, which I believe is important. Another part of assemblies I find significant is the cheerleaders and dancers that perform at assemblies work tirelessly on choreography they should be announced and appreciated with excitement. Putting a spotlight on our band who always play outstandingly and tries to include up-to-date music. Creating assemblies that have fun uplifting energy is my top priority. I believe we can achieve the level of assemblies even louder than the assemblies before covid. Comparing my freshmen year assemblies to now, I've noticed less enthusiasm but I think with me as Commissioner of assemblies we can achieve more SPHS spirit than ever. I‚Äôm a natural public speaker and I'm open to suggestions that any student might have. Including everyone in these SPHS memories is important as we have lost so many opportunities to do such over quarantine.

            <p>
              1. I think my desire to become the Commissioner of Assemblies started with Color Day. Even thought I was a sophomore, it was my first color day due to Covid. Me and my friends dressed up and were even able to take first place. Seeing such a large event and so many people having a good time made me want to one day lead an event as large as that. I am usually called the "louder" friend amongst my friends and I am a very naturally outgoing person.
3. I have always enjoyed spirit days and have always tried my best to participate. I even stay after school to help the sophomore ASB out with valentines grams or whatever they needed. As before mentioned I love spirit days and even won the sophomore color day. I promote academic achievement in my own life by always setting goals and trying my best to achieve them. Although sometimes I do fall short.

            <p>
              I was motivated to run because I felt many people in highschool lack an element of relaxation in their life, and can become wound up. On the opposite side, I believe many people can become too loose and begin to hold a fixed mindset that nothing in or surrounding school is fun, and to both of these extremes I believe I could be the answer. Personally, I think a big part of leading anything is leading from the front by portraying the appropriate energy of the crowd and involving myself in activities. I also believe that portraying all classes in a realistic light, and giving them their each chance to shine respectfully, while still giving upperclassmen the respect they desire and lowerclassmen the time of day. I am very skilled at working with others. What I would consider my biggest social strength is being able to look at life from other people's shoes. This enables me to easily find compromise, and makes others feel that they are being heard. I have learned through months away that one cannot expect others to do all the work for them, and yet you still have to hold everyone to do their own responsibilities. I also have a lot of actual connections with people of every kind. This enables me to recognize what motivates people and work most productively off of that.

            <p>
              Hi, my name is Declan S and I'm running to be your next Commissioner of Athletics of SPHS. I was extremely motivated to run for the Commissioner of Athletics as I have seen firsthand the extremely positive impact that high school athletics can have for all students of SPHS. Throughout my 3 years at South Pas, I have been a member of both our men‚Äôs soccer and volleyball teams. In my experiences within the sports, I have grown strong bonds with all of my teammates, and it is an experience that I wish all SPHS students could receive. As Commissioner of Athletics I will advocate for even greater student participation in sports.
        As Commissioner of Athletics, it will become my responsibility to help ensure positive sportsmanship throughout all SPHS athletes. I will help advocate for good sportsmanship by highlighting the different traits that should be carried by all good athletes, such as respect, responsibility, honesty and compassion.
        Furthermore, I will try my absolute hardest to expand school and class spirit across all of our school sporting events. I will accomplish this by consistently posting and spreading word of all sports games occurring at our school for every week, through the SPHS athletics instagram page. I will furthermore keep students engaged with athletics by updating on scores and helping highlight star athletes on a consistent basis. Thank you for your time and remember to vote me for Commissioner of Athletics.

            <p>
              Hey, everyone! I‚Äôm Stephanie L, and I‚Äôm running to be your Commissioner of Clubs. I personally believe that school clubs are a significant part of our campus. Students are able to meet others that share the same interests, gain leadership experience, have fun, and volunteer in their community. After joining many clubs my freshman year and starting two of my own as a sophomore, I knew that I would run for this position. 
              With my leadership experience, I know that I am capable of looking over the 85 clubs we have on campus. My skills stem from being the two-year president of the Animal Care and Smiles for a Change Clubs. I communicate efficiently with my club officers, advisors, and members about what our club has been up to and what needs to be done. In addition, I reach out to different organizations to coordinate donation drives and activities. As one of our Dance Program captains, I believe that I am approachable, easy to work with, and responsible, which allows students to easily come up to me with any questions about their clubs. My various leadership positions as president, vice president, treasurer, secretary, and more have taught me valuable skills that make me a strong candidate for this Commissioner position. I genuinely love being a part of the club culture on campus and feel that my passion, dedication, and work with many clubs at SPHS would make me a great Commissioner of Clubs.

              Hello! My Name is Aidan H and I am running for Commissioner of Clubs. I was motivated to run for this position because I believe that clubs are one of the best ways to explore possible interests and opportunities while additionally forging new relationships, and being the Commissioner of Clubs would allow me to facilitate and improve that experience. In the past, I have been in clubs such as Speech and Debate and Lionheart, and Tassel. I know what it takes to run a successful and productive club meeting and I am eager to apply that knowledge to Club President‚Äôs meetings. I will keep track of all of the clubs through regular email updates to the Club Presidents as well as posts on Clubs Google Classroom. This will allow me to stay in touch with all clubs and keep them updated on any upcoming activities. This year, the Club Commissioner created the club newsletter, which I would love to promote and carry into the 2022-23 school year, which would greatly improve club engagement. In addition to this, I will advocate for club spotlights during assemblies into the second semester in order to promote and fully represent the clubs at our school.

            Hi South Pas! My name is Lauren D and I‚Äôm running for Commissioner of Publicity because I‚Äôm a HUGE proponent of school spirit! Already, I‚Äôm that friend in the group chat telling everyone to participate in spirit days, sending reminders about late starts and ticket sales‚Äîthat‚Äôs the kind of attention and enthusiasm I want to bring to the student body. After the year we had online, I wanted to do it all. Currently, I‚Äôm rehearsing for the spring musical, I'm on Pep‚Äôs Varsity Flags squad and I‚Äôm also one of the team‚Äôs administrative captains. Last semester, I had an internship with the South Pasadena Chamber of Commerce where I got to learn about promoting and advertising local businesses and events on a variety of platforms‚Äîsocial media, websites, posters and flyers, even plain old door-to-door word of mouth. These experiences have helped me hone my skills in communication, planning, leadership, and collaboration‚Äîskills I am sure will be put to good use if I am elected. I believe getting involved in school events and organizations is the best way to get the most out of one‚Äôs time at SPHS. If voted in, I plan to ensure each student is well informed about all South Pas happenings by utilizing a variety of platforms in a way that is comprehensive, accessible, informative, and beautiful.

            Hey, South Pasadena High School! My name is Allison L, and I am interested in running as your next Commissioner of Publicity. Being an active member of our school‚Äôs community, I have noticed a lack of equal student representation when it comes to student-campus involvement due to a lack of information. As the future Commissioner of Publicity, I want to make it my responsibility to increase the overall participation in student activities, making sure that all students feel as if they have a voice on campus for involvement. Virtually, I plan on using our student body's social media platforms to promote a heavier emphasis on the diversity of our student body, while simultaneously using a physical bulletin board on campus, allowing students to update themselves on upcoming events and activities, allowing ASB to effectively reach the demographic of students who may not have social media. From designing the SAC card two years ago, being a Design Associate for our local student-run newspaper, Tiger, and even running professional social media accounts for the SPHS FBLA Chapter and the South Pasadena Chinese American Club, I believe I have the right qualifications to effectively manage the responsibilities that come with being the Commissioner of Publicity. Thank you for taking the time to read my candidate bio, and I look forward to getting to know you all very soon!

          <span>Commissioner of School and Community</span>
          <p>
            The position of Commissioner of School and Community would give me the opportunity to create a more unified and helpful community. My goal is to make sure everyone feels like they belong. When I transferred to SPHS the school was very welcoming to me, and I would love to pass on that feeling to other students. I love the idea of organizing events to bring the community together, such as the seasonal blood drives and canned food drives. Having us work together for the greater good in contributing to a humanitarian cause truly connects our school. One of the problems on campus within students is the high academic competition. SPHS is a leading school, which means the curriculum is highly rigorous, causing high pressure on our students to perform extraordinarily. Tying into aspects of at-home life, on top of the distress school already brings, as your Commissioner of School and Community, I will influence change on campus. One of my goals is to implement mental wellness days. I‚Äôm aware our school already has these, but I would love to keep executing these programs and work closely with the Health and Wellness Officers and Ms. Prime to support mental health awareness. Furthermore, I would love to promote different ways to relieve stress and encourage the idea that grade perfection isn‚Äôt everything. I want to encourage more conversation about effort than the outcome and try to get students to work collaboratively instead of against each other.

        <span>Commissioner of Spirit</span>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm a great candidate for the Commissioner of Spirit because I‚Äôm on multiple teams including track, cross country, pep, and the dance team. I show my spirit whenever I'm with my pep squad at games, pep rallys, assemblies, and I always make sure to participate on spirit days. One thing that sets me apart from the other candidates is that I also participate in track and cross country. As an athlete, my favorite thing is cheering people on in races. I love seeing that smile on my teammate‚Äôs face for a split second and the glimmer of hope in their eyes, because I know that moment in a race, when your legs feel like a ton of bricks and your breath is heavy, and way too fast for comfort. It‚Äôs in that instant that you find somebody right around the corner cheering your name that motivates you to open up that stride just a little bit more and speed up that cadence so you get that personal record you‚Äôve been yearning for. I want to be that somebody for all of the students at SPHS and that‚Äôs the Commissioner of Spirit‚Äôs job isn‚Äôt it? I know not all students can relate to the terrible pain of a cross country race, but I want to see students become more spirited in all aspects of their lives. I appreciate the pride our student body already shows for our school and I hope to preserve and increase this amazing energy we‚Äôve got going! I intend to do so by creating a community and environment at SPHS where we can feel supported, included, and most importantly inspire each other to do better. Through events like pep rallies, school bonding activities, spirit weeks/days, open mics for people to express themselves (writing, music, dance), and definitely some faculty/staff competitions, we can make this happen. Go Tigers!
